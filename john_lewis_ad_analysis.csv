"Oh and I’m not a dad, only have daughters… but I’ve shared many a spliff with my 20 yr old who is a born again 90s raver and festival goer.  She doesn’t see me as 53, it feels like we are on a level and she always asks if I’m ok and that in her mind we are both still girls living on earth for the first time. She’s so emotionally mature.. more than most adults.
The Alison Limerick track which I haven’t heard since I was about her age just really hit hard and of course I sent her the link straight away ( she’s just started uni and I miss her so so much ) 
Of course she won’t get the message for a few hrs.. sat night in Liverpool at 20. Defo be out living her best life 🫶🏻",YouTube,Positive,0.5904356837272644,Topic 2,The Father/Age Narrative,0.5115426149160376

"Beautiful reading so many comments from dads in a similar chapter of life as the ad. It really spoke to me too. In kind of a different way - I'm 37, twin boys are about 9 months old, and I spend a lot of time thinking about how these are days and years to treasure, even when it doesn't feel like it. This ad does as good a job as anything I can imagine of reminding me that I'll look back on these days with great yearning, even as the future brings experiences of its own.

Yes, an English family where father and son are centre stage is definitely a welcome change.

The musical choice instantly invokes nostalgia for the generation X’ers out there.

The tone was perfect and the use of memory of the son from baby to toddler to teenager is powerful stuff.

Your father isnt the bumbling idiot the media likes to make out he is.

How anyone is seeing and thinking it's good it's insane.. it's literally highlighting how men don't grow up and want to remain kids with no responsibility and an easy life..and it encourages not talking about problems or showing gratitude in words but using gifts instead .. like how men say sorry with flowers instead of just saying sorry which is half the problem you're all so miserable..not a cute Christmas advert.,YouTube,Negative,0.8649792075157166,Topic 3,Father-Son Relationship & Music,0.6636357193153339

"Después de tantos años de graduado y de tener una ampla experiencia en esta profesión, me permito analizar algunos mensajes comerciales e institucionales, y siempre llego a la misma conclusión: la buena actuación es fundamental para lograr cautivar al espectador. 
Parece una conclusión muy básica, porque realmente lo es, obviamente, todo unido a un buen guión creativo y a una excelente producción, todo funcionará.

"John Lewis, you've absolutely smashed it for me this year. 

I’m 46, and lately I’ve been looking back a lot… my younger self, my rave days, the freedom, the late nights.
I miss it more than I expected.

These last few years have been rough.
My mental health took a dip and it affected my kids.
My youngest and I have had the hardest time.
My career took over much of my parenting and I missed more than I want to admit.

But life has a way of giving us a second chance.
This past year he’s had his own struggles, and somehow that opened a space for both of us to heal.
He’s helped me.
I’ve helped him.
We’ve met each other again.

And the funny thing is — we found our way back through music.
House music.
The beats of my younger days.
We share songs, talk about memories, dance in the kitchen, gone to gigs
Different generations, same rhythm.

To me, that’s what parenting — and Christmas — is about.
Not being perfect.
Not getting it all right the first time.
But finding a way to reconnect, laugh again, and love each other in real, everyday ways.

Here’s to second chances.
To softer hearts.
To music that carries us home.

"The ad plays around with the notion of Father and Son, while deploying the terms ""words"" and ""gift"". The Alison Limerick song is meanwhile ""Where  love lives"" - a Club hit from 1992. That's a gap of 33 years to now, the typical number of years on Earth ascribed to the Saviour, the word made flesh, the Son of the Father who rose again and delivered the most loving gift of eternal life to all of us. The album originally including the song was 'And Still I rise"" - a title that (also) honours the poem of the late Maya Angelou - a taster of various faiths before deciding on Christianity. And so this is CHRISTmas... I hope you have fun.",YouTube,Neutral,0.6928308606147766,Topic 3,Father-Son Relationship & Music,0.4253667592486561

"I see it as before he had children and a family, his life and joy revolved around raving and that carefree lifestyle. Once he became a father, everything changed-those experiences were left behind as his priorities shifted toward his responsibilities. But through the present and the music, he was taken back to that part of himself, reminded of what he once loved. Then came the realisation that this part of his life had faded when he became a dad. Yet, having his son recognise and connect with that passion-sharing that moment together-was deeply meaningful, because his son is now his whole world.",YouTube,Neutral,0.5245733261108398,Topic 3,Father-Son Relationship & Music,0.7262965808040807
"44 year old Mum to an almost teenager and an 8 year old, and I think this is supposed to represent the fun of a lost youth, which pales into insignificance when you have your babies and they change your world - the most important thing is the world you’ve made with your children, everything else is secondary. The son has bought the record to remind the Dad of his younger days, but no matter how good those days were, the days that came after, with him in the world, were so much more precious. And the Dad clearly appreciates the silent gesture, as your children reach those teenage and pre-teen years, they communicate less and less, but the son is letting the gift speak for him.

"Well I didn’t expect that! I thought it would be all about luring people into spend spend spend! Spend your money on things because they’re going to say it’s a bargain! I’ve read so many positive and negative comments. I get it. We live in Britain, the UK whatever you want to call us and no matter what, there always someone unhappy or got an opinion. Fair play, I understand BUT what I love about this ad is that JL have approached the Christmas d in such a different way. Made it more emotional and real .. not necessarily encouraged us to spend on their website but I know there will be so many out there who were born on the 70’s, raised in the 80’s and raved in the 90’s and this will be a positive reminder see or trigger to share those amazing experiences we had. Best gift ever .. telling those stories and sharing the music that made us so happy and still does .. I felt no need to suddenly buy from their website .. it made me want to get my tape deck out and play my 90’s tracks to my 13 yer old and tell him about life without phones, social media, meeting friends without texting .. you just knew they’d be there .. the time of that Alison Limerick track was amazing .. I know some won’t get it but I do feel a whole lot of you will ..and it just prompts you to share your good times and memories and have quality time chattering .. best gift ever JL!!

"For me this advert is perfect. The power of music. The power of memory. The love the father has for his son.

I think this is rather beautiful and beautifully cast and acted. For me I think there are a mix of meanings running through. I see the main story being that the dad is rather sad and reflects on raising his son and now the son being older. Perhaps he is feeling distant from him or the life they live is not what it was. Burdens of the now are real and life is.more difficult. So the son does what children do best; he shows loves and gives the dad hope by 'taking him back to a happier time'. He then helps the dad maybe grappling with age and to let go of his youth and reconnect with what is important now; his family. The passing of time with its joy and sadness eh; so lovely to capture this for all us parents. The joy of children and love and the sadness of loss and ageing. There's always time to dance and have a hug with the ones we love. The best tune chosen too! The 90s were a great time to be alive!,YouTube,Positive,0.8293388485908508,Topic 3,Father-Son Relationship & Music,0.4377435477942289

What a depressing advert! Actually thought at one point it was saying the son had died. Dreadful advert. It’s no wonder the son can’t talk to his dad when the dad doesn’t talk either.

"So, an emotionally stunted man has an insidious and pernicious resentment of his (25 year old?) autistic son because he grew up. The son (a people pleaser due to his father's neglect) mirrors his father's awkwardness and is too scared to hand him the thoughtful gift that he naively hopes will make his father validate him as an autonomous person and love him unconditionally. The father is too selfish to do this and continues to infantalise his son to the point of picturing him as a newborn, albeit now at least showing him some of the affection which has clearly been lacking throughout his life. 

This should be a cautionary tale about fostering healthy relationships with your children so that they don't end up parenting you, like in this advert.

To be honest, the aesthetic isn’t even unique either - M&S have been tugging on the nineties heartstrings with a Rhythm Is A Dancer sample in one of their Christmas ads this year… 

Boots served a somewhat similar vibe albeit with an eighties banger (Smalltown Boy) a couple of years ago… 

I’m admittedly starting to feel like I’m creeping towards becoming an old fart the more I hear these songs being used in a “retro sense”… and I personally love the music they have sampled… but I don’t think it’s a magnificent and iconic advert by any stretch and I have a totally first hand experience of the 1990’s as an era…",Reddit,Negative,0.5875128507614136,Topic 2,The Father/Age Narrative,0.6080325955271382

"If you don't like music, if you've never collected music, if you've never looked back with fondness on LPs inherited from your father, looking at the treasured one(s) that friends gave them as going-away presents when the family moved the length of the country ..... then you probably don't get it.

"I agree that the use of it is a cynical ploy but as a short film in itself, it's quite moving. 

Parents of teenagers can become anxious that their kids are drifting away from them and also feel a contradictory pride in seeing their offspring moving towards independence. This can be confusing and provoke guilt for partially wishing that time would stand still and our role remain constant.

Males are notoriously repressed, in general, in showing feelings and teenage lads go through an awkward phase. The advert makes use of that father/son dynamic and subverts it at the end with a hug.

Then there's the nostalgia vibe for Gen Xers.

While the use of all this is emotionally manipulative, the ad is well acted and skillfully constructed. I have to confess, as a sentimental bloke, it did make me tear up. I feel quite angry at John Lewis for pulling my strings in that way in order to sling product. It makes me not want to shop there. 

Credit due to the filmmakers and actors though.",Reddit,Neutral,0.5413721799850464,Topic 4,Polarized & Cultural Reaction,0.45501975948941886

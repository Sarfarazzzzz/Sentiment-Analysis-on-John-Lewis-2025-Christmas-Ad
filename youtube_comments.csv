YouTube,@lucyraybould,"Oh and I’m not a dad, only have daughters… but I’ve shared many a spliff with my 20 yr old who is a born again 90s raver and festival goer.  She doesn’t see me as 53, it feels like we are on a level and she always asks if I’m ok and that in her mind we are both still girls living on earth for the first time. She’s so emotionally mature.. more than most adults.
The Alison Limerick track which I haven’t heard since I was about her age just really hit hard and of course I sent her the link straight away ( she’s just started uni and I miss her so so much ) 
Of course she won’t get the message for a few hrs.. sat night in Liverpool at 20. Defo be out living her best life 🫶🏻",2025-11-09T00:16:51Z,0

4 daughters, 28,22,20 (she’s inherited the raving crown) and 18.. 3 granddaughters and life couldn’t be more different but that tune took me right back. Happy carefree times.

In kind of a different way - I'm 37, twin boys are about 9 months old, and I spend a lot of time thinking about how these are days and years to treasure, even when it doesn't feel like it. This ad does as good a job as anything I can imagine of reminding me that I'll look back on these days with great yearning, even as the future brings experiences of its own.

Yes, an English family where father and son are centre stage is definitely a welcome change.

The tone was perfect and the use of memory of the son from baby to toddler to teenager is powerful stuff.

YouTube,@rinbeans,"John Lewis, you've absolutely smashed it for me this year. 

I’m 46, and lately I’ve been looking back a lot… my younger self, my rave days, the freedom, the late nights.
I miss it more than I expected.

These last few years have been rough.
My mental health took a dip and it affected my kids.
My youngest and I have had the hardest time.
My career took over much of my parenting and I missed more than I want to admit.

But life has a way of giving us a second chance.
This past year he’s had his own struggles, and somehow that opened a space for both of us to heal.
He’s helped me.
I’ve helped him.
We’ve met each other again.

And the funny thing is — we found our way back through music.
House music.
The beats of my younger days.
We share songs, talk about memories, dance in the kitchen, gone to gigs
Different generations, same rhythm.

To me, that’s what parenting — and Christmas — is about.
Not being perfect.
Not getting it all right the first time.
But finding a way to reconnect, laugh again, and love each other in real, everyday ways.

Here’s to second chances.
To softer hearts.
To music that carries us home.

Once he became a father, everything changed-those experiences were left behind as his priorities shifted toward his responsibilities. But through the present and the music, he was taken back to that part of himself, reminded of what he once loved. Then came the realisation that this part of his life had faded when he became a dad. Yet, having his son recognise and connect with that passion-sharing that moment together-was deeply meaningful, because his son is now his whole world.",2025-11-06T10:55:45Z,0

The son has bought the record to remind the Dad of his younger days, but no matter how good those days were, the days that came after, with him in the world, were so much more precious. And the Dad clearly appreciates the silent gesture, as your children reach those teenage and pre-teen years, they communicate less and less, but the son is letting the gift speak for him. It’s such a lovely touching advert. Probably the best one JL have done yet.",2025-11-06T10:49:50Z,4

YouTube,@aliceh1977,"Well I didn’t expect that! I thought it would be all about luring people into spend spend spend! Spend your money on things because they’re going to say it’s a bargain! I’ve read so many positive and negative comments. I get it. We live in Britain, the UK whatever you want to call us and no matter what, there always someone unhappy or got an opinion. Fair play, I understand BUT what I love about this ad is that JL have approached the Christmas d in such a different way. Made it more emotional and real .. not necessarily encouraged us to spend on their website but I know there will be so many out there who were born on the 70’s, raised in the 80’s and raved in the 90’s and this will be a positive reminder see or trigger to share those amazing experiences we had. Best gift ever .. telling those stories and sharing the music that made us so happy and still does .. I felt no need to suddenly buy from their website .. it made me want to get my tape deck out and play my 90’s tracks to my 13 yer old and tell him about life without phones, social media, meeting friends without texting .. you just knew they’d be there .. the time of that Alison Limerick track was amazing .. I know some won’t get it but I do feel a whole lot of you will ..and it just prompts you to share your good times and memories and have quality time chattering .. best gift ever JL!! No commercial pressure to buy buy buy .. a lovely advert encouraging good relations and just making time for each other ❤️",2025-11-06T01:08:54Z,1

YouTube,@RebeccaBradshaw-t7o,I think this is rather beautiful and beautifully cast and acted. For me I think there are a mix of meanings running through. I see the main story being that the dad is rather sad and reflects on raising his son and now the son being older. Perhaps he is feeling distant from him or the life they live is not what it was. Burdens of the now are real and life is.more difficult. So the son does what children do best; he shows loves and gives the dad hope by 'taking him back to a happier time'. He then helps the dad maybe grappling with age and to let go of his youth and reconnect with what is important now; his family. The passing of time with its joy and sadness eh; so lovely to capture this for all us parents. The joy of children and love and the sadness of loss and ageing. There's always time to dance and have a hug with the ones we love. The best tune chosen too! The 90s were a great time to be alive!,2025-11-05T23:26:17Z,2

YouTube,@fontaine9-4,"So, an emotionally stunted man has an insidious and pernicious resentment of his (25 year old?) autistic son because he grew up. The son (a people pleaser due to his father's neglect) mirrors his father's awkwardness and is too scared to hand him the thoughtful gift that he naively hopes will make his father validate him as an autonomous person and love him unconditionally. The father is too selfish to do this and continues to infantalise his son to the point of picturing him as a newborn, albeit now at least showing him some of the affection which has clearly been lacking throughout his life. 

This should be a cautionary tale about fostering healthy relationships with your children so that they don't end up parenting you, like in this advert.

We have a great relationship but can't remember the last time I had a hug from her. It's been the occasional fist bump here and there with a good bit of banter from time to time. For the son in the video to be anticipating his dads response was perfect and then for the Dad to do some dad dancing with the son smiling at the end was great. Also the daughter and mum in the background made it so wholesome. Such a warm, nostalgic and reflective take on parenting teenagers in todays world. Bravo JL.",2025-11-05T09:40:37Z,3

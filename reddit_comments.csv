Reddit,BillyJoeDubuluw,"I think because John Lewis have done a couple of really big and well received Christmas adverts people seem to wait in suspense for what they will come up with next and it’s largely never as good as expected anymore, but the expectation has become the default all the same… 

To be honest, the aesthetic isn’t even unique either - M&S have been tugging on the nineties heartstrings with a Rhythm Is A Dancer sample in one of their Christmas ads this year… 

Boots served a somewhat similar vibe albeit with an eighties banger (Smalltown Boy) a couple of years ago… 

I’m admittedly starting to feel like I’m creeping towards becoming an old fart the more I hear these songs being used in a “retro sense”… and I personally love the music they have sampled… but I don’t think it’s a magnificent and iconic advert by any stretch and I have a totally first hand experience of the 1990’s as an era… ",2025-11-06 15:14:21,3

I'm surprised it isn't re-charting, obviously not having as big an impact as previous JL adverts.

Having just watched it though, two things spring to mind -

1. I never understand how much talk there is around an advert I could have made myself. Not exactly big budget is it?
2. How does a two minute long TV ad air? I don't watch broadcast TV these days, but that must cost an utter fortune? They can't be showing an edited version, it wouldn't make sense if bits were cut out.",2025-11-06 16:22:05,1

I wasn’t clubbing in the 90s; I was clubbing in the late noughties/early tenties, but having had a baby of my own recently and coming to terms with having given so much up for my son (while simultaneously gaining something far more) it did really bring a tear to my eye.",2025-11-07 16:59:40,1

Reddit,Round_Engineer8047,"I agree that the use of it is a cynical ploy but as a short film in itself, it's quite moving. 

Parents of teenagers can become anxious that their kids are drifting away from them and also feel a contradictory pride in seeing their offspring moving towards independence. This can be confusing and provoke guilt for partially wishing that time would stand still and our role remain constant.

Males are notoriously repressed, in general, in showing feelings and teenage lads go through an awkward phase. The advert makes use of that father/son dynamic and subverts it at the end with a hug.

Then there's the nostalgia vibe for Gen Xers.

While the use of all this is emotionally manipulative, the ad is well acted and skillfully constructed. I have to confess, as a sentimental bloke, it did make me tear up. I feel quite angry at John Lewis for pulling my strings in that way in order to sling product. It makes me not want to shop there.
